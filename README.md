# TacoCloudRestApi

This repo is created during study Spring in Action 6.

I`ve modified Taco Cloud project for Rest Api.

This project starting with Chapter 7.

Small changes comparing to Original:

- I`m not added State and Zip fields in Taco Order class
- I`m using only Spring Data Jpa in Chapter 3
- I`ve skipped Chapter 4
- I`m using 2 active profile("default" for h2 database and "mysql" for MySQL)
